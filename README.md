Tools:
  - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/)
    - For backend, db, & hosting. Likely using their [React library](https://github.com/firebase/reactfire).
  - [Material-UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-ui)
    - front-end UI framework.
  - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/subscriptions)
  - [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node)
    - would prefer to avoid initially.
